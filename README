# sigreset

A simple utility to reset the SIGINT and SIGTERM default handlers before
executing its arguments.

## Usage

```
usage: sigreset CMD [ARGS...]
```

## Building

Currently,
the only tested platform is Ubuntu 18.10,
but it should work anywhere where a BSD make and some BSD library functions are
available.

On Ubuntu:

```
# apt install bmake
# bmake
```

## Motivation

Work around the inability of JetBrains to handle signals properly:
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-157989

It is essentially the same as the utility from Tom Lee
(https://github.com/thomaslee/signal-reset),
but I wanted to have fun writing such a utility myself.
Also, the other program is lacking a proper license.
